Graphics Card: Select "VirtIO-GPU" Machine: Choose "q35" (this is the modern machine type recommended for desktop VMs) 
BIOS: Select "OVMF (UEFI)" for better compatibility 
Add EFI Disk: Enable this option
SCSI Controller: VirtIO SCSI
Qemu Agent: Enable this option

The VirtIO-GPU provides better graphics performance than other options, while UEFI boot offers modern features and better compatibility.


To get the installer to work, using SCSI, change the controller type from the default of "Virt0 SCSI Single" to "Virt0 SCSI" (no single - I guess this VM is now married to ProxMox.)
